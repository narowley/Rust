# Overview

Just as with my previous projects, I want to expand my knowledge to new and unusual projects. That's why today I chose to work with Rust to create a pig latin translator. This piece of software is designed to take user inputs and translate the string into pig latin for each word. My purpose in this software was to sharpen my programming skills as well as create a project that's more fun than the usual projects that I work on. I wanted to create a project that I was passionate about.

# Development Environment

To develop this program, I used the Rust programming language as well as Visual Studio Code for my coding. Rust is a very similar coding langauge to C and C++. It's intended to be imbeded in software as well as used for software. I didn't use any extra libraries, but I did use a couple of functions that are listed within the source code.
